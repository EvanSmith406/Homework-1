The differences and similarities for GUI and CLI is quite interesting, they both have a lot to offer in terms of organizing and computer literacy and excel in their respective domains. What I appreciate about GUI is how much it is a visual language that really benefits from simple yet effective logos and signs, whatever to get the point across in the most quick and easy way possible. For CLI’s, it looks like something straight out of the Matrix and is quite intimidating but there is a beauty to it, in the way that if you start getting a grasp of it you can move at a much quicker pace and have more control over everything. The biggest similarity has to be the simple notion of organizing and getting to your destinations as quickly as possible and either way works great but they work much better when applied correctly.
